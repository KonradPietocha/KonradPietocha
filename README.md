### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a frontend developer and I like to develop and learn (not only frontend) technologies. I am currently working at <b>Vanto IT Solutions</b> where I'm a junior software developer. We build great applications for clients such as [MOTO-PROFIL](https://moto-profil.pl/), [AGATA-MEBLE](https://www.agatameble.pl/), [PROFIAUTO](https://profiauto.pl/). Unfortunately, here you can view only my own public repositories  ðŸ‘‡, which is only a small part of what I'm doing on a daily basis.
<br>
### My pages:
[JUSTINE GALLERY](https://konradpietocha.github.io/Justine-Gallery/) ***** [source code](https://github.com/KonradPietocha/Justine-Gallery)-->React, Redux

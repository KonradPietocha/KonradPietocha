### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a frontend developer and love to grow and learn (not only frontend) technologies. Currently, I work at <b>Vanto IT Solutions</b> where I'm a junior software developer, building great applications for our clients, especially for [MOTO-PROFIL](https://moto-profil.pl/), [AGATA-MEBLE](https://www.agatameble.pl/) and [PROFIAUTO](https://profiauto.pl/). Unfortunately, on this github you can view only my own public repositories  ðŸ‘‡, which is only a part of what I do on a daily basis.
<br>

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a frontend developer and love to grow and learn (not only frontend) technologies. Currently, I work at <b>Vanto IT Solutions</b> where I'm a junior software developer. We are building great applications for our clients ( [MOTO-PROFIL](https://moto-profil.pl/), [AGATA-MEBLE](https://www.agatameble.pl/), [PROFIAUTO](https://profiauto.pl/) ). Unfortunately, on this github you can view only my own public repositories  ðŸ‘‡, which is only a small part of what I'm doing on a daily basis.
<br>
### My pages:
[JUSTINE GALLERY](https://konradpietocha.github.io/Justine-Gallery/) ***** [source code](https://github.com/KonradPietocha/Justine-Gallery)-->React, Redux
<br>
[CURRENCY](https://konradpietocha.github.io/react-table/) ***** [source code](https://github.com/KonradPietocha/react-table)-->React, Hooks
